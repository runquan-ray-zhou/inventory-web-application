# General Warehouse Inventory Web App

## Introduction

Hi, my name is Runquan (Ray) Zhou, a software developer refining my skills through the Pursuit program.  This GitHub repository showcases my project, where I've replicated the "Bookstore Inventory" webpage to demonstrate my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and Javascript (DOM).  This project marks my foundational understanding of these coding language in my learning journey.  Looking ahead I aim to implement various functionalities into a comprehensive warehouse inventory web application.  The cold storage warehouse inventory webpage serves as the initial template for this ambitious project.  Thank you for taking the time to explore my work.

I gained inventory control experience at a small frozen seafood import, export, wholesale company in Brooklyn, NY.  In this company of 5 employees, I worked closely with the owner, handling clerical tasks and occasionally assisting with the warehouse and delivery duties.  My responsibilities included maintaining inventory control for products stored in various cold storage facilities across the US. 

I managed inventory simultaneously across at least six different warehouses using only pen, paper, and Excel sheets due to limited resources.  This restricted my ability to generate comprehensive data for the company.  It's been over 12 years since I've left the company, and I've often thought about how much more efficient I could have been with an inventory control program or app.  Now drawing from my experiences, I aim to develop such a tool.  In this GitHub repository ReadMe, I will provide an overview and breakdown of the features and functionalities of this inventory control web application.
 
 ## Overview

This is a web application for any type of general large scale warehouse inventory control.  The first type of warehouse I based this app on is a "Cold Storage" warehouse.
